# Reports whether the dependency pins that no package-manager updater covers —

# in install-gitleaks.sh, TensorFlowLiteSwift in Podfile.lock — are still the
# newest published release.
# Writes a markdown report to stdout.
#
# Exit codes: 0 every pin is current, 1 at least one pin has moved, 2 the check
# itself could not run. A caller must distinguish 1 from 2; exit 1 is a result,
