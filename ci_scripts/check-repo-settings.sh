# Usage: ci_scripts/check-repo-settings.sh [owner/repo]
#
# Reports whether the repository settings this project relies on are actually
# in force: the status check CONTRIBUTING.md requires before merge, the private
# reporting route SECURITY.md offers as an alternative to email, and the secret
# scanning and push protection that stand between a credential and a public
# commit. None of them is a file, so none appears in a diff and no review can
# catch one being absent. Writes a markdown report to stdout.
#
# The repository defaults to $GH_REPO, then to whatever `gh` resolves for the
# working directory.
#
# Exit codes: 0 every setting is as it should be, 1 at least one is not, 2 the
# check itself could not run. A caller must distinguish 1 from 2; exit 1 is a
# result, not a failure.
