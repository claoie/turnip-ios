# Models

The app expects a MoveNet Thunder model file here, named exactly:

```
movenet_thunder_int8.tflite
```

This file is **not committed to the repo** (see the root `.gitignore`) — it's a ~7 MB binary
ML artifact. Release builds (Xcode Cloud → TestFlight) download and checksum-verify it in
`ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh`, so it is always inside the archived app bundle. For local
development, fetch it yourself with the steps below. The app builds and runs without it,
but nothing pose-related works: the camera records without live pose (it logs the load
failure under the `LivePose` category and every take goes through Processing), Processing's
analysis fails with a "model not found" error, and so does the pose diagnostic screen.

## Getting the file

The model is the TF Lite int8 build of `google/movenet/singlepose/thunder/4`, published
under **Apache 2.0**, which is the licensing `docs/DESIGN.md` assumes when it bundles the
weights. Download it from TF Hub — no account needed, and the URL serves the raw `.tflite`
directly. From the repo root:

```
$ curl -L -o Turnip/Models/movenet_thunder_int8.tflite \
    "https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/movenet/singlepose/thunder/tflite/int8/4?lite-format=tflite"
$ shasum -a 256 Turnip/Models/movenet_thunder_int8.tflite
```

The second command must print the checksum recorded below — run it, because the load-time
check in `MoveNetThunderModel` cannot tell the float16 build apart from this one, so the
checksum is what separates them (see "Checking you got the right file").

Provenance last checked **2026-09-14**: the TF Hub URL serves bytes matching the checksum
below. (The Kaggle model page,
`https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/movenet/tfLite/singlepose-thunder-tflite-int8`, is
still live under Apache 2.0, but its API download endpoint now returns 404, so TF Hub is
the fetch path.)

## Checking you got the right file

Two checks cover this, and they catch different wrong files — run the checksum first, because
it is the one that catches the variant the app cannot detect for itself.

### The checksum and byte count

```
$ shasum -a 256 Turnip/Models/movenet_thunder_int8.tflite
b72fed22707cd6fb94b5a248b9bddb9c062b9f445471b4fa263407cf6d222011
```

The file is **7,126,768 bytes**. Its input tensor is `[1, 256, 256, 3]` uint8 and its output
tensor is `[1, 1, 17, 3]` float32 — the shapes `FramePreprocessor` and `PoseKeypoint.parse`
are built around.

If the checksum disagrees, you have a different artifact. The likely candidates are the
neighbouring MoveNet builds, and the two closest ones are worth knowing about:

| Instance | Bytes | Input tensor | Output tensor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `singlepose-thunder-tflite-int8` (this one) | 7,126,768 | `[1, 256, 256, 3]` uint8 | `[1, 1, 17, 3]` float32 |
| `singlepose-thunder-tflite-float16` | 12,584,128 | `[1, 256, 256, 3]` uint8 | `[1, 1, 17, 3]` float32 |
| `singlepose-lightning-tflite-int8` | 2,894,840 | `[1, 192, 192, 3]` uint8 | `[1, 1, 17, 3]` float32 |

The Thunder float16 build reports the same shapes and the same element types as the int8
build, so nothing readable at load separates the two: it loads, allocates, and emits keypoints
the parser accepts, and the only difference is the numbers that come out. float16 is also the
escalation `docs/DESIGN.md` names before any model swap, so quietly running it instead would
pre-empt the accuracy comparison that choice exists to decide. The checksum and the byte
count are the only checks that tell them apart, which is why both are recorded here.

(Sizes are the uncompressed artifact sizes the model page reports per instance; the tensor
shapes are read out of the files themselves.)

### The load-time check

`MoveNetThunderModel` reads the bundled file's input and output tensors at load and rejects
anything that isn't the Thunder singlepose int8 shape — `[1, 256, 256, 3]` input, `[1, 1, 17,
3]` output — with a visible error instead of silently producing worse keypoints. If the
diagnostic fails with an input-shape or output-shape error, the file is a different variant
(Lightning is 192x192) — go back to the download step. If it fails with a data-type error like
"Model input wants Float32, the frame packing writes uInt8", it's the fp32 Thunder build
rather than the int8 one — also go back.

This check cannot see the float16 build, whose input tensor is uint8 at the same resolution,
which is what the checksum above is for.

## Why a folder reference

`project.yml` references this directory as an XcodeGen **folder reference**, not a group. That
means Xcode picks up the file the moment you drop it in — you don't need to rerun
`xcodegen generate` just because the model file didn't exist yet when the project was first
generated.
