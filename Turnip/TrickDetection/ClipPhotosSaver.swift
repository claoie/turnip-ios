/// leaves the device" promise still holds — every read this type does (`fetchAlbum(titled:)`
/// below, checking for an existing album before creating a duplicate) stays inside the device's
/// own Photos library, never the network.
///
/// **Unverified assumption, needs a device pass before this is trusted:** `fetchAlbum(titled:)`
/// is written on the assumption that add-only authorization limits what it can find to albums
/// this saver itself created in an earlier call — `PHAccessLevel.addOnly`'s general contract is
/// read visibility scoped to what the app added, but `fetchAssetCollections(with:subtype:options:)`
/// takes no parameter that states this, and it has not been run under either full or limited
/// Photos access on a real device or Simulator (none available in this environment). Two ways
/// that assumption can be wrong, both degrading to the same outcome via `addToAlbum`'s fallback:
/// - **The fetch sees nothing** (a collision with an album another app created, invisible under
///   add-only).
/// - **The fetch sees an album it can't edit** (the complementary collision: an existing album
///   this saver didn't create, visible but not modifiable under add-only — `PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest`
///   returns `nil`).
///
/// Either way, `addToAlbum` creates a new album with the SAME title instead of adding to the
/// one `fetchAlbum` found or failed to find — so a Photos search for that title can turn up
/// more than one album, all named identically, none of them "the wrong one" to look in. The
/// clip still lands *somewhere*, just not consolidated — a save never fails or drops album
/// membership because of this, it can only spread one save's worth of clips across an extra,
/// same-titled album per occurrence.
