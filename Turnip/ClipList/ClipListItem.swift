/// button removes the item outright (`ClipListViewModel.delete(_:)`) instead of
/// setting this, so it never goes `true` on one in practice. `Identifiable` by a
/// stable `id` (not the window times) so view state survives a re-run of detection
/// producing slightly different windows.

/// `isOriginal` marks the one item — always `ClipListViewModel.items[0]` — that
/// stands for the source video already in Photos rather than a derived clip: it
/// carries the full-video window and full-frame crop, is never opened in the
/// editor, and its trash button is the reversible `isTrashed` toggle above rather
/// than an outright removal.
