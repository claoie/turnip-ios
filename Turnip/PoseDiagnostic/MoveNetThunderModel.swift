/// See Turnip/Models/README.md for how to obtain the bundled model file.
///
/// An `actor` rather than a class for two reasons: TFLite's `Interpreter` is not thread-safe, so
/// inference calls must be serialized, and actors run on the cooperative pool — never the main
/// thread — so `runInference` (CIContext resize, BGRA→RGB repack, `invoke()`, dequantize) is
/// structurally kept off the UI thread. Being an actor also makes the model `Sendable`, so it can
/// be captured by the `@Sendable` frame handler in `VideoFrameSampler.sampleFrames`.
///
/// One consequence to keep in mind: `runInference` is synchronous compute (tens of ms per frame)
/// running on a cooperative-pool thread, so it occupies one of the pool's threads (pool width ==
/// core count) for the duration of each call. That is fine for the diagnostic, where there is
/// exactly one caller and the sampler serializes frames anyway. If the pipeline later runs other
/// async work concurrently with inference, the escape hatch is a custom `SerialExecutor` backed by
/// a utility-QoS queue, or `Task.detached` for the compute — not more actors.
///
/// Construct via `load()`, not `init`: an actor's synchronous `init` runs in the *caller's*
/// context, so calling it from a `@MainActor` `Task` would put the model mmap + tensor allocation
/// on the UI thread. `init` is private to make that impossible to do by accident.
