/// The v2 Share Sheet action for one exported clip
/// (`docs/DESIGN.md` § "Publishing to social media (iOS Share Sheet)").
///
/// A thin wrapper around SwiftUI's `ShareLink` (iOS 16+, the repo's deployment floor):
/// Turnip hands the exported clip's file URL to the system share sheet, iOS enumerates
/// every installed app that accepts a video — Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts,
/// Messages, Photos, AirDrop — and the target app owns the compose step. Zero server
/// involvement, per the design doc.
///
/// Built only on Foundation/SwiftUI types so it compiles standalone on `main` (the
/// standalone-contract convention): no Turnip module imports, so whichever screen
/// adopts this doesn't pull the pose pipeline along with it.
///
/// The caller owns the file's lifetime: the URL must keep pointing at an existing file
/// from when this view appears until the share sheet dismisses. In particular, the
/// adopting screen's run-end scratch-directory cleanup has to move to screen dismissal
/// before this button is wired in there — otherwise the sheet offers a file that is
/// already gone.

    /// moves the on-device file, no CDN staging.
