# Turnip privacy compliance notes

The single home for the answers App Store Connect asks for at submission
time, so nobody has to reverse-engineer them later. v1 is the fully
on-device release; anything that changes with v2 (upload, accounts) is
marked as such below.

The plain-language version users and reviewers see is
[`site/privacy.html`](../site/privacy.html), published at
<https://hoiekim.github.io/turnip-ios/privacy.html> and used as the
Privacy Policy URL in App Store Connect. This doc is the technical source
it's summarized from — keep both in sync when data handling changes.

## App Store "nutrition label" answers (v1)

These answers describe v1. The contribution code is now built and the
committed Info.plist points it at the farm (`TURNIP_FARM_ENDPOINT`), so a
build from this tree makes the calls listed under "Contribution" below:
**before such a build is submitted, the label, the manifest's collected data
types and `site/privacy.html` have to change.** The Photos usage string
already has: it now says Turnip never uploads the videos, not that nothing
leaves the device. Until then, these are the answers for the release in the
store.

**Data Not Collected.** The v1 app collects no data, full stop:

- No accounts, no sign-in, no identifiers.
- No analytics. No third-party crash-reporting SDK; crash/hang metrics arrive
  Apple-mediated (Xcode Organizer + MetricKit) under the user's own "Share With App
  Developers" opt-in — not declarable as collected data. See `docs/DESIGN.md`
  decision #7.
- No calls to any Turnip-controlled server in the v1 path. A `URLSession` client
  for OTA model updates does exist — `Turnip/ModelUpdates/ModelUpdateClient.swift`,
  the only networking code in `Turnip/` — and it refuses any scheme
  but `https`, it takes its endpoint as a parameter rather than holding one, and
  `ModelUpdateService.checkForUpdates` returns on a `nil` base URL before it
  reaches the client. The app runs that check on launch and on every
  foreground, and the URL comes from the `TURNIP_MODEL_UPDATE_ENDPOINT`
  Info.plist key, which now names the farm (`https://turnip.hoie.kim`) — so the
  app polls the public `GET /api/models/current` manifest on launch and on
  every foreground. That request carries no identifier, no account, and no
  sign-in, and before the farm promotes its first model it answers 404
  NO_MODEL and nothing further happens. The client's own test exercises the
  `https` guard without issuing a request.
  Bytes do cross the network when PhotoKit downloads an iCloud-only video
  (`isNetworkAccessAllowed` in `PhotoVideoResolver`/`ThumbnailLoader`) — from
  the user's own iCloud, through a system framework. Videos are read from the
  Photos library the user grants access to, processed on-device by the bundled
  MoveNet model, and exported clips are written back to Photos. While the
  in-app camera records, the same model scores the live camera frames
  on-device to draw the skeleton and detect clips; the frames are reduced to
  model input in memory and released immediately, nothing but the recording
  itself is written, and the only trace left behind is per-recording timing
  and count figures in the device's own log. The in-app camera also reads
  the phone's gravity vector from Core Motion while it records and writes
  the resulting roll angle into the recording as a metadata track
  (`Turnip/Camera/RollTrackRecorder.swift`, format in
  `Turnip/Media/RollTrack.swift`), so the editor can level the clip
  without guessing from the picture; this is the device-motion API, which
  needs no `NSMotionUsageDescription` and raises no prompt (unlike the
  pedometer and activity APIs), and the angles live only inside the user's
  own video file in their Photos library. If the user
  removes a saved clip from the Profile and asks for its video to go too, the
  video is deleted from Photos — a user-initiated, on-device change to their
  own library, not data leaving the device. Saved clips' trick names, whether each shows
  the user, and the Profile's achievements are kept in an on-device library
  ("The clip library and the Profile" below) and never sent anywhere.
- Nothing is uploaded, shared, or transmitted to any Turnip-controlled server.

## Privacy manifest (`Turnip/Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`)

Declares: no tracking (`NSPrivacyTracking` false, no tracking domains),
no collected data types, and three required-reason API categories —
`NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryFileTimestamp` with approved reason `C617.1`
(the orphan sweep in `PhotoVideoResolver` reads `.creationDateKey` on files
inside the app's own `tmp/` container),
`NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategorySystemBootTime` with approved reason `35F9.1`
(elapsed time between in-app progress reports, measured via `systemUptime`),
and `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults` with approved reason `CA92.1`
(`TurnipSettingsStore` persists the settings screen's four keys, readable only
by the app itself). See the audit table below.

Required-reason API audit. `ci_scripts/check-privacy-manifest.sh` enforces it
on every pull request: it matches a table of API spellings — which lives in
the script, since the categories and evidence below are not themselves
greppable — against everything under `Turnip/`, and fails when a hit has no
matching `NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType` in the manifest. So a `No` row whose
category is undeclared is a claim CI re-checks: a call site landing behind it
fails the build. The other direction is a note rather than a failure — a
declared category nothing references is reported without failing, because
Apple rejects undeclared usage, not an unused declaration.

| API category | Used? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| UserDefaults | Yes — CA92.1 | `TurnipSettingsStore` reads four keys in `init` and writes through to `UserDefaults` on every published change; `TurnipSettingsStore.shared` takes the `.standard` suite. All four keys are app-local — no app group, no shared suite outside the screenshot and preview harnesses — which is what CA92.1 approves. |
| File timestamps | Yes — C617.1 | `PhotoVideoResolver.deleteOrphanedTemporaryExports` reads `.creationDateKey` via `resourceValues(forKeys:)` on files in the app's own `tmp/` container — in-container metadata reads, declared with approved reason C617.1. (`PHAsset.creationDate` is PhotoKit metadata on user-granted assets, not a file-timestamp API.) |
| System boot time | Yes — 35F9.1 | `ProgressReportClock.shouldReport` (in `ProcessingPipeline.swift`) defaults its clock to `ProcessInfo.processInfo.systemUptime` to measure elapsed time between in-app progress reports; `LivePoseRecording` and `LivePoseFrameTap` read the same clock for inference timing and thermal accounting. All in-app elapsed-time measurement — declared with approved reason 35F9.1. |
| Disk space | No | No volume-capacity resource keys and no `statfs` family call sites. The clip library is written without one. A free-space check before rendering a highlight or writing the library would change this row (see "The clip library and the Profile" below). |
| Active keyboards | No | The category covers querying `UITextInputMode.activeInputModes`, which nothing does. `SettingsView` has one `TextField` for the album name; presenting a keyboard is not the declarable access. |

Third-party SDKs: the only dependency is `TensorFlowLiteSwift`
(`Podfile.lock` resolves its `Privacy` subspec, which carries the pod's
own `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`), and it is not on Apple's list of SDKs that
require a manifest/signature. If a dependency is added, check both.

## Photos access

- Home requests `.readWrite` for the gallery. PhotoKit offers no
  read-only level — the choices are add-only (can't enumerate the
  library) or read/write — and exporting clips back to Photos needs the
  write half anyway, so one honest prompt covers both. The write half is
  also what lets the Profile's Clip view delete a saved clip's video
  (`PhotoAssetDeleter`, `PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets`) when the user
  picks "Remove and Delete Video from Photos" — PhotoKit shows its own
  "Allow Turnip to delete?" system confirmation before the deletion happens,
  on top of the one-time read/write grant.
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` explains the read side in plain
  language. `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` ships alongside it
  because both save paths into `ClipPhotosSaver` call
  `requestAuthorization(for: .addOnly)`, and iOS terminates the app on
  that call when the string is absent. On neither path does the user
  normally see the string: the clip-save path is reached from Home
  through Processing and Name Clips, and the camera opens from a tile in
  Home's grid (UIUX §1b), which only exists once Home has its Photos
  access. Reaching either save means the read/write grant from Home is
  already in place, which determines add-only as authorized, so the call
  returns without presenting a second prompt. (Until UIUX Rev 29 the
  camera was a page beside Home, reachable with nothing granted, and
  this string was the first Photos prompt a camera-first user saw.)
- `PHPhotoLibraryPreventAutomaticLimitedAccessAlert` is set: with
  limited access the app shows its own "select more" affordance instead
  of iOS re-prompting on its own schedule.

## Camera and microphone

- The in-app camera requests both when its screen first starts
  (`CameraCaptureViewModel.start()`); a recording needs both, so
  `CameraAccessState` treats them as one grant. `NSCameraUsageDescription`
  and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` explain each in plain language.
- Video and audio go only into the take's movie file,
  `tmp/turnip-recording-<uuid>.mov`, which is saved to Photos through
  `ClipPhotosSaver` and then deleted (`RootTabView.handleRecorded`). If
  the save fails, the file stays in `tmp/` rather than destroying the
  user's only copy of the footage.
- Live pose inference reads frames from the same capture session, and
  the roll track reads Core Motion's device motion (both described
  above); neither adds a permission prompt of its own.

## Temp-file and cache hygiene

- **Composition exports.** Slow-motion/edited videos come back from
  PhotoKit as compositions with no file URL, so `PhotoVideoResolver`
  exports them to `tmp/` (`turnip-composition-export-<uuid>.mov`).
  The owning screen (`VideoLibraryViewModel`, which owns the navigation `path`)
  deletes the export when its `SelectedVideo` leaves the path (back-out or a new
  selection) and also when a resolution is cancelled after the export finished
  but before the push — so browse-and-back-out, the dominant interaction,
  never accumulates files. `TurnipApp` sweeps orphans left by crashed sessions
  at launch. The prefix is what makes both the delete and the sweep recognize
  only our files.
- **Clip exports.** Tapping "Save Clips" on Name Clips (`ClipListViewModel.save()`)
  stages every derived clip not yet in Photos in a fresh `tmp/turnip-export-<uuid>/`
  scratch directory, hands each one to Photos through `ClipPhotosSaver`
  (add-only), and deletes the whole directory once the run ends — success or
  failure, since there is no Share action here to keep a file alive for. A
  `save()` call killed mid-run is swept by the next one
  (`sweepStaleExportDirectories`); the `turnip-export-` prefix is what makes
  the sweep recognize only our directories.
- **Thumbnails** are in-memory only — `PHCachingImageManager` for the
  Home grid (`ThumbnailLoader`) and `AVAssetImageGenerator` frames for
  Name Clips' cards (`ClipThumbnailLoader`). There is no on-disk thumbnail
  cache. If one ever lands, it belongs in `Caches/`, never `Documents/`,
  so iOS can evict it and it isn't backed up.
- **Partial live pose.** When live inference covers a take only in part,
  the keypoints it did score are packed and streamed to a `tmp/` scratch
  file as they are scored (`turnip-live-pose-<uuid>.bin`), on the pushed
  `SelectedVideo` and in `VideoLibraryViewModel`'s store of the last eight
  such takes, so Processing analyzes only the rest (`docs/LIVE_POSE.md`).
  The file is deleted when the take is detected or its partial is discarded,
  and swept at launch when a session died before that — so a long session
  holds at most a 64 KB buffer in memory instead of the whole take. A partial
  that reaches Processing stays on disk in the eight-take store until it is
  evicted. It never leaves the device, is never backed up, and is deleted at
  end of use or swept at the next launch.
- **Offline run scratch.** Processing a take from the file scores it the same
  way and streams the scored frames to a `tmp/` scratch file
  (`turnip-live-pose-<uuid>.bin`) instead of holding them in memory, so a long
  take holds at most a 64 KB buffer in memory while it is scored and detected.
  The file is deleted when the run ends — success, failure, or cancellation —
  and swept at launch when a session died before that. It never leaves the
  device, is never backed up, and holds only the packed keypoints, never video.
- **Everyone in frame.** The pose model finds up to six people per frame, so
  bystanders' keypoints are computed and held alongside the athlete's, in either person mode (`docs/MULTI_PERSON.md`). Following
  everyone, the poses of the people who own a clip travel with the clips to Name Clips.
  None of it leaves the device: it rides the same session scratch file as the
  athlete's frames and is gone with it; only the pose of someone with a saved
  clip is kept on disk ("The clip library and the Profile" below).
- **Logs** go to `os.Logger` only; nothing is written to log files.
- Nothing is written to `Documents/` anywhere in v1.

## Export compliance

`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` is `NO`: v1 talks to no Turnip-controlled server,
so TestFlight uploads don't prompt for export-compliance answers. (The only
network is iCloud downloads through PhotoKit, over HTTPS — exempt either way.)
The OTA model-update client now on `main` refuses any scheme but `https`, which
is exempt as well, so the flag stays `NO` once an endpoint is configured.
Revisit only if non-exempt encryption or non-HTTPS networking is introduced.

## Contribution (built; changes the answers above before it ships)

What a build with `TURNIP_FARM_ENDPOINT` set sends to the farm
(`CONTRIBUTION_DESIGN.md` §5, §8), all over HTTPS through an ephemeral
`URLSession` (no cache, no cookies on disk):

- **The vocabulary fetch**, `GET /api/taxonomy/current`, when Name Clips
  opens, at most every six hours. No identifier and no session go with it.
- **Sign in with Apple**, from Settings or the contribution sheet, at the
  user's tap. No name or email scope is requested; the farm sees the
  identity token, whose only claim it keeps is the per-app `sub`.
- **A contribution**, only with Contribute named clips on, only for clips
  the user named and saved, and only once the account has agreed on the
  confirmation sheet, which asks the first time and covers every later
  save. It goes in the background, not at a tap: the video's `video_id`
  (SHA-256 of the Photos identifier, never the identifier), the pose
  keypoints of the whole session as a TKP1 blob, each clip's window in
  pose frames, its trick names with how each was given, the session token
  and the source's key.
  Never the video, a thumbnail, whether a clip shows the user, or a
  location.
- **Account deletion**, from Settings: `DELETE /api/sources/:id` for every
  source the app holds a key for, then `DELETE /api/account`.

On the device: the session token, the Apple user ID it belongs to (for the
credential-state check), the Apple user ID that agreed to contribute and one
random key per contributed source live in the Keychain, readable after first
unlock and never migrated off the device. So does the clip library's device
mark (below), a random value that names no account and is never sent.
The fetched vocabulary is cached in `Application Support/turnip-vocabulary.json`.
A contribution waiting to send is kept in `Application Support/ContributionOutbox/`,
with its pose keypoints, until the farm holds it. The folder is excluded from
device backups, and turning Contribute named clips off or deleting the account
empties it. Nothing is written to `Documents/`. No required-reason API was
added: the Keychain isn't one, and the vocabulary cache and the outbox are read
and written without file metadata.

What changes before release, and is not decided here: the nutrition label
(the Apple `sub` and pose keypoints, linked to the account until it is
deleted, by the user or after 24 months without use, so the label reads
"linked to you"), `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes` in the manifest, and
`site/privacy.html`. `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` stays `NO`: HTTPS
only. Contribution is off on EU, EEA and UK App Store storefronts, only
clips marked as the user are contributed, and the farm records each
agreement with its disclosure version (`CONTRIBUTION_DESIGN.md` §5.4,
§8.1).

## The clip library and the Profile (core built; the rest planned)

The first v2 release (master plan Phase 2a; [`PROFILE_DESIGN.md`](PROFILE_DESIGN.md))
changes on-device data handling only. Nothing below is collected in the App
Store sense: it is processed and stored on the device, and none of it is sent
to a Turnip-controlled server.

Built (`Turnip/Profile/`):

- **No network of its own.** The library and the Profile make no call. The
  vocabulary naming suggests from arrived with contribution (above): it
  carries no identifier and no session, and the farm's access logs, kept 30
  days at most (`BACKEND_DESIGN.md` §8), are its only record. The Profile
  reads the vocabulary already held and fetches nothing.
- **The first persistent user data.** `ClipLibrary` keeps one JSON file,
  `Application Support/ClipLibrary/library.json`, written by Name Clips' save
  and by naming on the Profile: for each video that produced a saved clip,
  its Photos identifiers (this device's and iCloud Photos', which finds the
  video again after a restore onto a new device), recording date and
  duration; for each saved clip, its clip ID, window in seconds, its own
  Photos identifiers, trick names,
  whether it shows the user, whether detection found it, how the trick model
  proposed it, which stored pose it was cut from, and its date; the levels
  and rep milestones earned; and, for the personal layer, the trick-model
  proposals the user trashed (below). Not `Documents/`, which stays empty,
  and not `Caches/`: it is in the user's iCloud and Finder device backups,
  which is how it survives a reinstall today. A file the app can't read is
  renamed `library-unreadable-<date>.json` beside it rather than overwritten.
  Deleting the app deletes it.
- **Pose keypoints.** Each save keeps the pose its clips were cut from, as
  gzipped TKP1 files in `Application Support/ClipLibrary/poses/`: the same
  keypoints a contribution would send, kept whether or not the user ever
  contributes. Following one person that is the take's pose; following
  everyone it is one file per person with a saved clip, and a clip added by
  hand keeps none, so nobody else the camera saw is written down
  (`docs/MULTI_PERSON.md`). A video reached without analysis has none. These
  files are in device backups, because they are the only copy once the
  original is gone from Photos. A pose is deleted when the last clip cut from
  it leaves the library, and deleting the app deletes them all. Only the
  personal layer's rebuild reads them (below).
- **New read, no new prompt.** `PHAsset.creationDate` of the video a save
  came from, under the existing Photos grant, to date its clips. The
  Profile reads each saved video's iCloud Photos identifier
  (`PHPhotoLibrary.cloudIdentifierMappings`) and maps it back to this
  device's (`localIdentifierMappings`); with full access, a record with no
  iCloud identifier that was saved on another device is matched by creation
  date and duration among the library's videos. To tell which device saved
  a record, each record keeps a random device mark, minted once and kept in
  the Keychain as never leaving the device
  (`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`). All of it stays on
  the device. The Profile
  also shows each saved clip's thumbnail and plays it from Photos by its
  identifier, and the Clip view can delete a clip's video through
  `PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets`, behind the system's own confirmation
  (Photos access, above).
- **Required-reason APIs.** None added: the library is written with
  `Data.write(options: .atomic)` and read back whole; it reads no file
  timestamps and checks no free space.

Planned:

- **More in the library.** A copy of the source video's location when it
  has one, spot names and favorites join the same file's directory in
  `Application Support/`.
- **Data written into the user's own files.** Each clip Save Clips exports
  carries a small Turnip metadata item (its clip ID, trick names, and whether
  it shows the user) and is named `turnip-clip-<clip_id>.mov`, the same
  pattern as the roll track in camera takes. A clip shared from the Photos
  app carries both; Turnip's own Share action, when it lands, strips them. No
  photo-library identifier, `source_id` or location is written into a file.
- **New reads, no new prompt.** Under the existing Photos grant:
  `PHAsset.location`, `PHAsset.isFavorite`, and
  `PHAssetResource.originalFilename` (`creationDate` is read already). No
  location permission is requested: Turnip's own camera records no
  location, so its takes get a place only when the user names one.
- **Temp files.** Highlight videos render to `tmp/turnip-highlight-<uuid>.mov`
  only for Save or Share and are deleted afterwards; the launch-time orphan
  sweep (`PhotoVideoResolver.deleteOrphanedTemporaryExports`) has to learn
  the prefix. No render cache; if one lands, it goes in `Caches/`.
- **Required-reason APIs.** Recheck the audit table and
  `ci_scripts/check-privacy-manifest.sh` when this lands. A free-space check
  before rendering or writing the library is
  `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryDiskSpace` (approved reason E174.1) and needs a
  manifest entry, or CI fails. Metadata reads on the library's own files fall
  under the file-timestamp category already declared (C617.1 covers files in
  the app's container).
- **`site/privacy.html`** changes when this ships, not before: it describes
  what the shipped app does.

## On-device personalization (built)

With an on-device trick model (master plan Phase 4), the app adapts it to
its user on the device ([`PERSONALIZATION_DESIGN.md`](PERSONALIZATION_DESIGN.md)).
Nothing below is collected in the App Store sense. No published model
carries embeddings yet, so on a real device the layer has nothing to read
and stays off.

Built (`Turnip/Personalization/`):

- **No network.** It works from the user's own clip library on the device.
  Nothing it learns or reads is uploaded, and it adds no field to a
  contribution, so no App Store answer changes.
- **New data on the device.** A derived, rebuildable cache: each saved
  clip's embedding and the central model's names for it, and each stored
  pose's borderline segments (their frames, the central model's score and an
  embedding), in `Caches/Personalization/personal-cache.json`, outside
  backups. The library doesn't hold it. It is logged as counts only.
- **Trashed proposals.** Each trick-model proposal the user trashes on Name
  Clips, on a pose the library keeps, leaves the source, the pose and two
  frame indices behind, and nothing else: no clip, export or name. They are
  in `library.json` in `Application Support/`, so in device backups, because
  they are the only copy of what they record. Each goes with its pose, and
  none is kept while the toggle is off.
- **Deleting it.** Settings' "Learn from my clips" toggle deletes the cache
  and the trashed proposals when turned off, and deleting the app deletes
  them. The farm holds none of it.
- **Background work.** A rebuild after each model update runs as a
  `BGProcessingTask` on external power, reading the stored pose
  ("The clip library and the Profile" above), never the video.
  BackgroundTasks is not a required-reason API, so the privacy manifest is
  unchanged.

Planned:

- **`site/privacy.html`** changes when this ships, not before.

## Deferred to v2 / later

- Server-side data handling for uploaded clips (retention, deletion
  requests, GDPR/CCPA) — belongs to `turnip-farm`; see `docs/DESIGN.md`
  decision #4 (retention: keep forever, user-deletable). In outline:
  - Contributions are linked to the account until it is deleted, by the
    user or after 24 months without use. Deleting it removes the link and
    the full pose recordings; short, transformed training segments stay
    with no account link unless the user also deletes their
    contributions. That makes them de-linked, not anonymous: someone with
    a video of the same clip could still match them to it
    (`BACKEND_DESIGN.md` §9 Q9). The farm records each agreement with its
    disclosure version (`CONTRIBUTION_DESIGN.md` §5.4).
  - The account can be deleted in-app; that removes every contribution
    the app still holds a key for.
  - The contribution sheet discloses both once, when the account first
    agrees, and asks users to contribute only clips of themselves or of
    people who agreed (`turnip-farm`
    `BACKEND_DESIGN.md` §1.2.17, §7.1, §8; `CONTRIBUTION_DESIGN.md` §5.4).
  - `site/privacy.html` needs the same update when contribution ships.
- Analytics / crash-reporting consent — `docs/DESIGN.md` decision #7:
  none in v1; crash/hang metrics arrive Apple-mediated under the user's
  own opt-in.
